/// scan only collapses a disc set into its `.m3u` when the system's extension
/// list names `m3u` (`SqliteDatabaseService._filterM3uReferencedFiles` is
/// gated on exactly that), and `ps2.json` did not name it — so the playlist was
/// never even indexed, whether the user wrote it by hand or with the built-in
/// multi-disc organizer. The flag saying PS2 *has* multi-disc games lives in
/// the same file and is easy to set without its other half, so pin both.
