/// scroll position.
///
/// Swapping the [PageController] alone is not enough. The position survives the
/// swap and goes on mapping pages to pixels at the old pitch, so the centred
/// card comes to rest off-centre — and because every later jump lands on that
/// same stale mapping, the error rides along with the selection instead of
/// washing out on the next move. The games carousel meets this the moment its
/// floating footer measures itself and the view gives up that height.
