/// screenshot in a panel closer to 2:1 grows until it hits the top and bottom
/// insets and then stops, with slack to spare on both sides. So every unit
/// reserved at the bottom comes off the image's *width*, and a reservation
/// that no longer matches the footer is a visibly smaller screenshot.
///
/// That is what went wrong: the other three panels were switched to the card's
/// [gameDetailsPanelBottomOffset] when the footer's height stopped being a
/// constant, and this one kept a hardcoded 110 against a footer that had come
/// down to 90.
