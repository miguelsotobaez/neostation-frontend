/// Screens that live on a route PUSHED OVER `AppScreen` must not walk the app's
/// top-level tab strip.
///
/// The strip and its header are behind the pushed route, so cycling it changes
/// nothing the user can see: the main display keeps showing the pushed screen
/// while the secondary display and the nav sounds report a tab switch. Worse,
/// tabs that host their own gamepad layer (Search, NeoSync, RomM) stack that
/// layer above the pushed screen's, so every later press — B included — is
/// handled by a screen that is not on the display, and the device needs a
/// restart. The games carousel shipped with `AppNavigation.previousTab` /
/// `nextTab` on its bumpers and did exactly that.
///
/// `AppScreenState._cycleTab` also refuses to cycle while `Navigator.canPop()`,
/// so this is the second of two locks. Keep both: the guard covers screens
/// nobody has written yet, this test keeps the wiring honest at the source.
