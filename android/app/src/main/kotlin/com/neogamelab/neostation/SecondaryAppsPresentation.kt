/**
 * A [FlutterPresentation] that additionally registers a MethodChannel on the
 * secondary display's Flutter engine, so the bottom-screen app dock can list,
 * icon-load and launch Android apps directly (the secondary engine cannot reach
 * the main app's "/game" channel — that's why other secondary features signal
 * the main engine through shared state instead).
 *
 * The base class creates and owns the engine in a private field and its
 * show()/dismiss() rely on it, so we let [onCreate] run normally and then reach
 * that engine via reflection to attach our channel. The field name is pinned by
 * the locked `sub_screen` dependency version.

     * Keeps the bottom screen alive when the user interacts with it.
     *
     * A [android.app.Presentation] is a [android.app.Dialog], so out of the box
     * it is cancelable: tapping the bottom screen moves input focus to this
     * window, and the next BACK press runs Dialog's default handling —
     * cancel() then [dismiss] — which tears the secondary FlutterView off its
     * engine and destroys it. The bottom half of the launcher then disappears
     * for good (the system launcher shows through) while the top half keeps
     * running, and nothing recreates it because the activity still holds the
     * dismissed Presentation. MainActivity already swallows BACK, but that only
     * covers its own window — this one is separate and never saw the key.
     *
     * Focus is the deeper problem: a focusable window here also makes the
     * bottom display the top-focused display, which is why HOME could relaunch
     * NeoStation onto the bottom screen (or re-prompt for the default launcher)
     * and why gamepad keys stopped reaching MainActivity after a tap. The
     * bottom screen is a touch-only status/dock surface with no text fields or
     * key handling of its own, so it never needs key focus: FLAG_NOT_FOCUSABLE
     * keeps touch working while leaving every key event, and the focused
     * display, with the main activity on top.
     *
     * FLAG_ALT_FOCUSABLE_IM rides along because FLAG_NOT_FOCUSABLE on its own
     * also declares "this window does not interact with the input method", and
     * such a window is layered *above* the IME window on its display. Dual-screen
     * handhelds can pin the keyboard to the bottom screen (on the AYN Thor,
     * Settings.System `ime_show_on_second`), and there the IME window is created
     * on this display while the edit field stays on the main one — so our
     * full-screen panel simply covered it and typing anywhere in NeoStation
     * showed no keyboard at all. Adding the flag inverts only that IME
     * relationship ("behind/away from the IME") and leaves key focus where it
     * is: still not focusable, so this window can never become the IME target.
