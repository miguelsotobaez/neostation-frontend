/// Decides what a Select (View) press means: a chord modifier, a plain tap, or
/// nothing at all.
///
/// Select does double duty — held, it unlocks the Select+face-button chords
/// (scrape / legend / random); tapped, it fires its own action (mute the
/// preview video). Telling those apart is fiddly enough to live on its own,
/// away from the event plumbing in `GamepadNavigation`:
///
/// * Android delivers a held button as a stream of auto-repeat presses, and
///   some controllers *pulse* down+up while the button is still physically
///   held. So neither "a press means a new hold" nor "a release means the
///   button is up" can be taken at face value — a press or release landing
///   inside [chordWindow] of the last one continues the current hold.
/// * A hold that unlocked a chord must not also fire the tap action when it
///   ends, or every scrape would toggle the sound too.
/// * Because of the pulsing, a tap can only be dispatched once [chordWindow]
///   has passed with no chord — see [releaseSchedulesTap] and [tapStillValid].
///
/// This type is pure: it holds no timers and reads no clock. The caller passes
/// the current time in and owns the deferred dispatch, which is what makes the
