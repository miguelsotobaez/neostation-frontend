/// Shared chrome for the intro screens: the shimmering logo pinned at the
/// screen centre with a status block hung directly underneath it.
///
/// The logo stays at the exact centre — the same spot the native splash icon
/// occupies — so it never moves across the native → startup → scan handoff.
///
/// The status block is placed from the logo's *rendered* bottom edge rather
/// than at a fixed fraction of the screen height. A fraction only clears the
/// logo on a screen tall enough for it: on short panels half the fixed-size
/// logo is taller than the offset, which is how the loading text and the scan
/// progress bar ended up printed across the glyph. For the same reason the
/// logo is scaled down once it would take more than [_maxLogoHeightFraction]
/// of the screen, which is what guarantees room for the status block below it.
///
/// Every size here is expressed in the app's 640×480 design space and scaled by
/// [scaleOf], so the splash keeps its proportions on a desktop window instead
/// of stranding a fixed-size logo in the middle of a 1920×1080 screen while the
/// rest of the app scales up around it. The status text the callers hand in is
/// the exception: it uses the damped [textScaleOf] instead, so a big window
/// grows the logo without turning the status line into a headline.
