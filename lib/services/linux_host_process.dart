/// Starts emulators on the host when NeoStation itself is packaged as a Flatpak.
///
/// A Flatpak cannot `exec` a host binary: its process namespace holds only the
/// runtime, so `Process.start('/usr/bin/retroarch', …)` fails with "no such
/// file" even though the file plainly exists on the machine. The escape hatch
/// is `flatpak-spawn --host`, which asks the session's Flatpak portal to start
/// the command outside the sandbox.
///
/// That capability requires `--talk-name=org.freedesktop.Flatpak`, which is
/// effectively arbitrary host command execution as the user — so it is confined
/// to this one file rather than spread across the launch paths. Everything that
/// starts an emulator goes through [start]; nothing else needs to know whether
/// NeoStation is sandboxed, and the day the Flatpak build is abandoned this
/// file is the only thing to delete.
///
/// The release path ships an AppImage, so on every machine this has run on
/// [isSandboxed] is false and [start] is a plain [Process.start] — the
/// sandboxed branch has never executed, and should be treated as unverified.
/// That is a statement about what has been *exercised*, not about what exists:
/// `linux/flatpak/` builds a working Flatpak, and one was installed on a Steam
/// Deck as recently as 2026-07-27. Verifying this branch is a matter of
/// building that manifest and launching a game from it, not of waiting for a
/// packaging format that has yet to arrive.
